# Awesome Anatomy

There are a massive number of known physiological objects in the human body.
But since that massive number is _finite_, sooner or later someone is going to
attempt to build a machine learning system to detect/segment/analyze
**every single one**.

By the nature of ML, the primary constraint is lack of data. Collectively, our sights are set on curating large, diverse, and high-quality annotated datasets for _each and every object_.

The Awesome Anatomy project hopes to keep track of our progress on this.

### Why start with Abdomen?

Why not?

### Don't lists of medical data already exist?

Yes! Shoutout to:

* kakoni for [Awesome Health](https://github.com/kakoni/awesome-healthcare)
* awesomedata for [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
* The NIH for [The Cancer Imaging Archive](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)

and more.

**So how is this project different?**

Previous lists have enumerated only _existing_ datasets. We see value in enumerating every _opportunity_ for a dataset, along the datasets in that area that have been made. We hope it will help codify a sense of how far we've come, and how far we have to go.
