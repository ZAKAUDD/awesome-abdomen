# Awesome Abdomen

> A curated list of anatomical features in the human abdomen and relevant open datasets.

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Inspired by the [Awesome Manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md), the goal is to create an **exhaustive** list of objects that could present in the human abdomen, along with all open datasets relevant to each object. See [awesome_anatomy.md](awesome_anatomy.md) for more information.

## Digestive Tract

The Digestive Tract is an organ system which takes in food, extracts energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract)

### Stomach

The stomach is located between the oesophegus and the small intestine. It secretes enzymes and acid to aid in digestion. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach)

### Small Intestine

Also known as the small bowel, the small intestine lies between the stomach and the large intestine, and it consists of three distinct regions: the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum. The primary function of the small intestine is the absorbtion of nutrients and minearals from food. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine)

### Large Intestine

Also known as the large bowel, the large intestine is the final part of the GI tract. In the order in which waste material travels through, it consists of cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and anal canal. It's primary purpose is absorbtion of water from waste material and storing feces. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine)

**Conditions & Open Data**

- Healthy Controls
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease

### Appendix

The appendix is a finger-like tube connected to the cecum at the junction of the small and large intestines. It is often considered to be a vestigial organ due to the lack of side effects upon its removal, but there is evidence to suggest that it supports the growth of useful intestinal bacteria.

## Accesories to Digestive Tract

These are organs which are not considered to be part of the digestive tract itself, but are nonetheless instrumental to digestion.
